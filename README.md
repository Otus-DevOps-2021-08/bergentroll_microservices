```bash
pushd docker-monolith/infra/packer/
# You may create variables file from variables.json.example
packer build -var-file=variables.json docker.json
popd 

pushd docker-monolith/infra/terraform/
# Terraform requires variables, see terraform.tfvars.example
terraform apply -auto-approve
popd 

pushd docker-monolith/infra/ansible/
# Inventory populates with terrafrom apply
ansible-playbook monolith.yml --tags app
popd 
```
